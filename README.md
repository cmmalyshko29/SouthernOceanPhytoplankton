<h1>Determing the Seasonality of Open Ocean Phytoplankton Blooms in the Southern Ocean Using NOAA Biogeochemical ARGO Float data</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
With the rising concern of the multitude of effects that humans have created on the environment, it has become of the utmost important to truly understand key planetary processes. One of the most understudied locations on our planet is the Southern Ocean surrounding Antarctica, due to its rough seas and remote locations. Of the many unknowns is the mechanisms behind the seasonal patterns of phytoplankton blooms dynamics. These blooms provide the world’s oceans with most of its food and helps to absorb excess CO2 from the atmosphere, so knowing their mechanics is extremely important. Through analysis of data provided from autonomous BioGeoChemical ARGO floats in the Bellingshausen Sea, it was found that chlorophyll a concentration and backscatter measurements were correlated. Seasonal blooms export carbon to the deep sea as these blooms decompose. These blooms are occurring before the peak warm periods of the summer months and can be greatly impacted by El Niño cycles and sea ice concentration. However, as climate change continues to grow, these impacts may worsen as well.

*This figure represents the total deployment track of float 6091 as it traveled through the Bellingshausen Sea. It started on March 27, 2014 at -60.053º, 174.161º ending on June 23, 2020 at (-61.555º, 272.614º)*

*This figure represents the seasonal variability seen annually in the biologicalproperties:temperature,chlorophyll,backscatter all over depth. The top left plot represents the annual variability of temperature as it changes with depth and seasonally. Date by year is on the x-axis, depth starting from the surface at the top (0m) to 2000m at the bottom, and the color represents the temperature value (below 0ºC in dark blue to 10ºC in yellow). The dashed lines indicate the period right before the warming where blooms are seen to begin in the plot below. The lower left plot indicates the annual changes in productivity as it changes with depth and seasonally. Date by year is on the x-axis, depth starting from the surface at the top (0m) to 200m at the bottom (note the change in depth), and the color represents the chlorophyll concentration used to measure productivity (0g/ liter in light green to 2.50 g/ liter in dark green). The plot on the bottom left represents the annual changes in export flux as it changes with depth and seasonally. Date by year is on the x-axis, depth starting from the surface at the top (0m) to 2000m at the bottom, and the color represents the concentration of backscatter used to measure export flux (0 1/m in light green and 10x10-41/m in dark green). The top right plot represents the relationship between chlorophyll and backscatter. A positive correlation is seen with a line equation of y=356.1507x + (- 0.0548), a R2 value of 0.7795, and p-value of 0*

*This figure represents the revealed seasonal patterns of phytoplankton blooms in the study region. The top left plot depicts the patterns seen by the active bloom via chlorophyll. The top right depicts the export flux out of the system via backscatter. The bottom plot depicts the two patterns overlaid (note the chlorophyll data is integrated to use the maximum values) and how export follows the peak bloom.*

*This figure represents the monthly sea ice extents from the coast of Antarctica into the Southern Ocean. The small icon represents where the float was in that month of the deployment. Yellow depicted no float to ice contact and green depicting float to ice contact. The white represents where the sea ice reached in that period and the pink line represents the median ice edge from 1981-2010. (Modified from NSIDC Sea Ice Index)*

*This figure represents the average annual sea ice concentration variation in both the Arctic and Antarctic. For the study in particular, the red line of the Antarctic is highlighted for significance. There is strong evidence of interannual variability and each of the changes balanced out the following year. But as highlighted in the green box, post- 2013 Antarctic sea ice has reached a threshold and has not significantly increased.*
